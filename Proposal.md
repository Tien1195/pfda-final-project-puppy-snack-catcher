## Description
Puppy Snack Catcher is a simple 2D game made with Python and Pygame where the player controls a puppy that must catch falling snacks while avoiding missing too many. This project relates to digital media and interactive arts by using animation, and user interaction to create an engaging visual experience.

Features
- **Player Movement**
  - The player (a puppy sprite) can move left and right using the A,D keys to catch falling snacks.
- **Falling Objects**
  - Random snacks fall from the top of the screen at increasing speed as the game progresses.
- **Collision Detection**
  - When the puppy catches a snack, the score increases; if missed, the player loses a life.
- **Score and Lives System**
  - Display score and remaining lives on screen using text rendering.
- **Game Over Screen**
  - When the player runs out of lives, display a “Game Over” message and option to restart or quit.

## Challenges
- Learning to use **Pygame** for sprite movement, collision detection, and event handling.
- Managing object spawning, timing, and increasing difficulty.
- Implementing basic UI elements like score counters and restart screens.

## Outcomes
**Ideal Outcome:**
- A fully working, polished 2D game where the puppy catches snacks, animations, and increasing difficulty levels.

**Minimal Viable Outcome:**
- A playable game where the player can move left and right to catch falling objects, the score updates correctly, and the game ends after missing several snacks.
