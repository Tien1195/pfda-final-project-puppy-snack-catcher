## Description
Puppy Snack Catcher is a 2D arcade-style game created using Python and Pygame. The player controls a small puppy that moves across the bottom of the screen to catch falling snacks while avoiding harmful or unwanted items. I chose this project because I enjoy simple, fast-paced games, and I wanted to learn how sprite movement, collision detection, and game flow work in an interactive digital environment. The game incorporates elements of digital media through animation, graphics, and user input to create an engaging experience. Throughout development, I learned how to manage sprite behavior, handle keyboard events, update the score in real time, and build UI components such as a game-over screen with restart and quit options.
